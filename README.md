## :dart: About

Use augmented reality (AR) to pick and place a selection of furniture models into your surroundings in real-time using your mobile's live video footage of your current surroundings. This project leverages ThreeJS to render the scene and furniture models, WebXR to enable AR mode with estimated real-time environment lighting, hit testing for furniture placement on the floor, and dom-overlay to render the UI.

View the live demo on your mobile at: https://padmavatisb.github.io/AR_RoomDecor/
